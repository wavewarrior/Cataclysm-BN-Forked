# Enchantments

Enchantments make it possible to specify custom effects provided by item, bionic or mutation.

### Fields

#### id

(string) Unique identifier for this enchantment.

#### conditions

(string array) How an enchantment determines if it should be active

All conditions must pass for it to be valid, if there are no conditions it is automatically true

For all basegame values see [here](#Basegame-Enchantment-Condition-ID-List)

#### emitter

(string) Identifier of an emitter that's active as long as this enchantment is active. Default: no
emitter.

#### ench_effects

(array) Grants effects of specified intensity as long as this enchantment is active.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Identifier of the effect
  "effect": "effect_identifier",

  // (required) Intensity. Setting to 1 works for effects that do not actually have intensities.
  "intensity": 2
}
```

#### hit_you_effect

(array) List of spells that may be cast when enchantment is active and character melee attacks a
creature.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Identifier of the spell
  "id": "spell_identifier",

  // If true, the spell is centered on the character's location.
  // If false, the spell is centered on the attacking creature.
  // Default: false
  "hit_self": false,

  // Chance to trigger, one in X.
  // Default: 1
  "once_in": 1,

  // Message for when the spell is triggered for you.
  // %1$s is your name, %2$s is creature's
  // Default: no message
  "message": "You pierce %2$s with Magic Piercing!",

  // Message for when the spell in triggered for an NPC.
  // %1$s is their name, %2$s is creature's
  // Default: no message
  "npc_message": "%1$s pierces %2$s with Magic Piercing!",

  // TODO: broken?
  "min_level": 1,

  // TODO: broken?
  "max_level": 2
}
```

#### hit_me_effect

(array) List of spells that may be cast when enchantment is active and character gets melee attacked
by a creature.

Same syntax as for `hit_you_effect`.

#### mutations

(array) List of mutations temporarily granted while enchantment is active.

#### intermittent_activation

(object) Rules that specify random effects which occur while enchantment is active.

Syntax:

```json
{
  // List of checks to run on every turn while enchantment is active.
  "effects": [
    {
      // Average activation frequency.
      // The exact chance to pass is "one in (X converted to turns)" per turn.
      "frequency": "5 minutes",

      // List of spells to cast if the check passed.
      "spell_effects": [
        {
          // (required) Identifier of the spell
          "id": "nasty_random_effect",

          // TODO: broken?
          "min_level": 1,

          // TODO: broken?
          "max_level": 5
          // TODO: other fields appear to be loaded, but unused
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### values

(array) List of miscellaneous character/item values to modify.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Value ID to modify, refer to list below.
  "value": "VALUE_ID_STRING",

  // Additive bonus. Optional integer number, default is 0.
  // Ignored for:
  // METABOLISM, MANA_REGEN, STAMINA_CAP, STAMINA_REGEN, THIRST, FATIGUE
  "add": 13,

  // Multiplicative bonus. Optional, default is 0.
  "multiply": -0.3
}
```

Additive bonus is applied separately from multiplicative, like so:

```json
bonus = add + base_value * multiply
```

Thus, a `multiply` value of -0.8 is -80%, and a `multiply` of 2.5 is +250%. When modifying integer
values, final bonus is rounded towards 0 (truncated).

When multiple enchantments (e.g. one from an item and one from a bionic) modify the same value,
their bonuses are added together without rounding, then the sum is rounded (if necessary) before
being applied to the base value.

Since there's no limit on number of enchantments the character can have at a time, the final
calculated values have hardcoded bounds to prevent unintended behavior.

For all basegame values see [here](#Basegame-Enchantment-Value-ID-List)

#### Flags

(array) of enchantment_flag_id values

For all basegame values see [here](#Basegame-Enchantment-Flag-ID-List)

Prevents recieving these effects, but any present effects will persist

#### Immune Fields

(array) of field_type_id values

Prevents environmental effects of fields from being applied

## Enchantment Values

```jsonc
{
  "id": "CLIMATE_CONTROL", // Id of enchantment
  "type": "enchantment_value", // Needed type
  "can_add": true, // Weather adding to the enchantment value will do anything; Default true
  "can_mult": true, // Weather multiplying to the enchantment value will do anything; Default true
  "can_max": false, // Weather getting the maximum value of this type will do anything; Default false
  "suffixes": [ // All of the suffixes this is quite literally the most complicated part
    [
      { "suffix": "COOLING", "desc_insert": [ "hot", "" ] }, // These show up as `CLIMATE_CONTROL_XXX`
      { "suffix": "HEATING", "desc_insert": [ "cold", "" ] } // Desc insert overwrites the below `desc_insert`, desc can also be replaced
    ],
    [ // Then you can define a second set, there can be as many sets as you want
      { "suffix": "TORSO", "replace": { "desc_insert": { "idx": 1, "val": "Torse" } } }, // Replace replaces based off starting at 0 index, so this replaces "" with "Torso"
      {
        "suffix": "ARM", 
        "replace": { "desc_insert": { "idx": 1, "val": "Arm" } },
        "suffixes": [ // These are a list of further suffix specific suffixes
          { "suffix": "L", "replace": { "desc_insert": { "idx": 1, "val": "Left Arm" } } }, // These suffixes could have additional nested suffixes too
          { "suffix": "R", "replace": { "desc_insert": { "idx": 1, "val": "Right Arm" } } } // These only show up as `CLIMATE_CONTROL_XXX_ARM_XXX`, never will they be applied to another type
        ]
      },
    ] // See below for further explination on why there are multiple sets
  ],
  "desc": "Keeps you comfortable against %1$s temperatures ( %2$s )", // Description, with support for formatting in additional strings
  "desc_insert": [ "all bodyparts", "" ], // The additional strings to format in
  "unsupported_conditions": ["character", "item_and_character"] // These values are called where these conditions cannot ever be used
},
```

### Suffixes Explination

Start by examining the above tree
There are two groups:

- COOLING and HEATING
- TORSO and ARM ( With Arm's children )

Order matters here, because COOLING came first, whenever you need the COOLING specifier, it must be first
I.E.
`CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING_ARM` works, but `CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_COOLING` is invalid.

The chain produced from the above json is as follows

- CLIMATE_CONTROL
  - CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING
    - CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING_ARM
      - CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING_ARM_L -> References CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_L
      - CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING_ARM_R -> References CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_R
  - CLIMATE_CONTROL_HEATING
    - CLIMATE_CONTROL_HEATING_ARM
      - CLIMATE_CONTROL_HEATING_ARM_L -> References CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_L
      - CLIMATE_CONTROL_HEATING_ARM_R -> References CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_R
  - CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM -> Does not reference CLIMATE_CONTROL to prevent stacking effects
    - CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_L
    - CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_R

This can be done with as many chains as wanted, but it gets increasingly complicated as more chains are added

In the docs, only the chain groups will be referenced, not the full list of enchantment values, due to the increasing number of enchantment children

When referencing these values in c++ or lua you always want to use the most specific value, the lower tiers are autofilled.
I.E. `CLIMATE_CONTROL_COOLING_ARM_R` should be what you reference, never `CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM_R`, or `CLIMATE_CONTROL_ARM` when getting a value
