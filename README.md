Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a roguelike with sci-fi elements set in a post-apocalyptic world.

While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle
to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead
civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you
the hell out of there.

Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant
insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself,
who want what you have.

Find a way to stop the Cataclysm ... or become one of its strongest monsters.

> Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a fork of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

#### Linux Instructions

While many of the dependencies that the game depends on are likely installed by default, some likely aren't installed by default on your distro.

Here are the commands for some of the most popular distro families:

- Ubuntu / Debian: `sudo apt install libsdl3-0 libsdl3-image-0 libsdl3-ttf-0 libsdl3-mixer-0 libfreetype6 zip libsqlite3-0`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install SDL3 SDL3_image SDL3_ttf SDL3_mixer freetype zip sqlite`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S sdl3 sdl3_image sdl3_ttf sdl3_mixer zip sqlite`

### Launchers

We do not support any launchers, none of them are maintained by any members of the development team and the vast majority of them do not keep up with our stable release cadence.

### Third Party Mods

Bright Nights uses a [mod registry](https://mods.cataclysmbn.org/) for easier discovery of mods not shipped with the main game.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is there a tutorial?

Yes, you can find the tutorial in the **Special** menu at the main menu (be aware that due to many
code changes the tutorial may not function). You can also access documentation in-game via the `?`
key.

#### How can I change the key bindings?

Press the `?` key, followed by the `1` key to see the full list of key commands. Press the `+` key
to add a key binding, select which action with the corresponding letter key `a-w`, and then the key
you wish to assign to that action.

#### How can I start a new world?

**World** on the main menu will generate a fresh world for you. Select **Create World**.

#### There is no music (or sound) in the game. How can I add it?

See where to place 3rd party mods, but replace mods/ with sounds/, this is the folder you will put it into

Find a soundpack such as the recommended one [Otopack](https://github.com/NarandBD/Otopack-BN-Mk-2).

Unzip the zip into the noted folder

Then finally select it from the settings, and then restart the game.

#### Where should I put 3rd-party mods?

If not in the List of common directories or it fails to work:

First boot up the game, select help, click 6 ( resolved game directories )

Place mods in the folder after "user mods: "

Otherwise:

For Windows users it is wherever your game folder is ( same level as the EXE ) /mods

For Android users using the non-legacy storage, the user mods folder is `Documents/Cataclysm-BN/mods`

For Linux users using the XDG directories (but NOT the flatpak): The user mods directory should be in `~/.local/share/cataclysm-bn/mods` (`~/.local/share/cataclysm-bn` is the user directory in general)

For flatpak users, the user mods folder is `~/.var/app/org.cataclysmbn.CataclysmBN/data/cataclysm-bn/mods` (the user directory in general is `~/.var/app/org.cataclysmbn.CataclysmBN/data/cataclysm-bn/`)

#### How do I update the game manually?

Assuming you've managed your mods appropriately, the correct update process is to delete the old data folder (alongside the gfx folder if you want to be extra safe) and _then_ overwrite the contents of the old BN folder with the new BN download. Deleting the old data folder is specifically necessary due to the fact that simply overwriting the old folder will **not** account for updates which delete files, as may happen with the obsoletion folder for example.

Don't delete any of the userdata folders!

Userdata folders are found by selecting help from the launch menu and clicking 6 ( resolved game directory )

#### I've found a bug. What should I do?

[Bug report](https://github.com/cataclysmbn/Cataclysm-BN/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) can
be submitted via debug menu.

Run `Submit a bug report on github` inside the game to submit an issue.

|   1. open Options (ESC) -> Debug Menu (a)   |              2. open Info (i)               |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| ![](docs/en/contribute/img/readme-bug1.png) | ![](docs/en/contribute/img/readme-bug2.png) |
|    3. Submit a bug report on github (U)     |      4. An link to issue is generated       |
| ![](docs/en/contribute/img/readme-bug3.png) | ![](docs/en/contribute/img/readme-bug4.png) |

It will open a bug report on browser with `Version and configuration` filled in.
