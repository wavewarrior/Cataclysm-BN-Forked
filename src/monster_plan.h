/**
 * Captures the complete output of monster::compute_plan().
 *
 * compute_plan() is designed to be a pure function with respect to the
 * monster's own state: it reads *this but does not write it.  All intended
 * mutations are collected here and applied later by monster::apply_plan() on
 * the main thread.  This split is the prerequisite for running planning in
 * parallel across all monsters.
 *
 * Fields use final values, not deltas, because plan() logic reads its own
 * writes mid-function (e.g. anger is incremented then tested in the same
 * pass).  Shadowing with locals is simpler than tracking deltas.
