 * Interface for objects that need to react when submaps enter or leave the
 * *simulated* set — i.e. the fully-active zone driven by all non-lazy load
 * requests (reality_bubble, fire_spread, player_base, script).
 *
 * **Important distinction:** these callbacks track simulation membership, not
 * memory residency.  A submap that transitions simulated → lazy_border fires
 * on_submap_unloaded even though it remains resident in its mapbuffer.
 * Similarly, lazy_border → evicted does NOT fire on_submap_unloaded; that
 * eviction is silent from the listener's perspective.
 *
 * Implementors that need to track memory residency rather than simulation
 * membership must maintain their own residency cache using
 * mapbuffer::lookup_submap_in_memory().
 *
 * Implementors are registered with submap_load_manager::add_listener() and
 * are notified during submap_load_manager::update().
